## What is ChemoSpec2D?

`ChemoSpec2D` is  collection of functions for working with 2D spectra.  It has been developed with NMR in mind, but other types of 2D spectroscopy may also be analyzed. `ChemoSpec2D` takes many of its cues from `ChemoSpec` and tries to create consistent graphical output and be very user friendly.  Tools to plot 2D spectra and carry out PARAFAC are the main features.

````r
install.packages("devtools")
