\title{Create a List of Levels}
\usage{
LofL(lvls, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{lvls}{Numeric.  A vector of the desired levels.}

\item{n}{Integer.  The number of times to replicate the levels; corresponds to the number of spectra to
be plotted.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n}; each entry is a vector of \code{lvls}.
}
\description{
When overlaying multiple 2D NMR spectra one needs to supply a vector of contour levels for each spectrum, as a list.
This is a convenience function which takes a set of levels and copies it into a list, ready for
use  with \code{\link{plotSpectra2D}}.

\code{\link{plotSpectra2D}} for an example.
