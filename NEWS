Changes in version 0.1.431 2018-08-19
     + Modified plotSpectra2D so that it will plot more than one spectrum.

Changes in version 0.1.419 2018-08-18
     + Added unit tests for .findNA.
     + Setting up unit tests for .findNA led to code clean up (better variable names and code notes).
     + Added unit tests for centerSpectra2D.
     + Added unit tests for chkSpectra2D.

Changes in version 0.1.412 2018-08-17
     + pfacLoadings now returns the modified Spectra2D object, not the loadings matrix.
     + inspectLvls can now access the loadings matrix, if present, in a Spectra2D object.

Changes in version 0.1.407 2018-08-16
     + A simple means of drawing a separate scale/legend for the contour plots was added.
     + pfacLoadings simplified, and some logical errors fixed.
     + An error in the construction of the data cube / array in pfacSpectra2D was fixed.  This task is now handled by helper function .makeArray since it is also required by centerSpectra2D.

Changes in version 0.1.373 2018-08-15
     + MUD1 gains some negative peaks for more comprehensive graphical tests.
     + .mapColors overhauled.
     + .plotEngine overhaulded.
     + .normAroundZero overhauled, and renamed to .symAroundZero.
     + Added convenience function inspectLvls to allow quick selection of levels.

Changes in version 0.1.328 2018-08-12
     + Improved MUD1 test data set.
     + Added centerSpectra2D function.

Changes in version 0.1.314 2018-08-07
     + Fixed incorrectly reversed F1 frequency removal in removePeaks2D.
     + Fixed a problem with where the gray "no data" lines were drawn in removePeaks2D (part of the problem was in .findNA).
     + sumSpectra2D now reports the number of data points in F2 and the number of slices in F1.
     + chkSpectra2D does a better job of checking and reporting about extra data.
     + Lots of documentation polishing.

Changes in version 0.1.295 2018-08-06
     + Rebuilt under latest R and updated packages.

Changes in version 0.0.0 2017-09-06
     + Package development begins with a port of relevant ChemoSpec materials.
     + No NEWS entries until we have an initial framework in decent shape.
