Description: A collection of functions for working with 2D spectroscopic data such as COSY and HSQC NMR spectra using appropriate chemometric techniques. 'ChemoSpec2D' deploys methods aimed primarily at classification of samples and the identification of spectral features which are important in distinguishing samples from each other. Each 2D spectrum (a matrix) is treated as the unit of observation, and thus the physical sample that went into the spectrometer corresponds to the  sample from a statistical perspective.  'ChemoSpec2D' takes many of its cues from 'ChemoSpec' and tries to create consistent graphical output and to be very user friendly.  Tools to manipulate and plot 2D spectra and carry out PARAFAC are the main features.
