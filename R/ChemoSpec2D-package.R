#' Exploratory Chemometrics for 2D Spectroscopy
#'
#' A collection of functions for working with 2D spectroscopic data such as COSY and HSQC NMR 
#' spectra using appropriate chemometric techniques. ChemoSpec2D deploys methods aimed primarily
#' at classification of samples and the identification of spectral features which are important
#' in distinguishing samples from each other. Each 2D spectrum (a matrix) is treated as the unit of
#' observation, and thus the physical sample that went into the spectrometer corresponds to the
#' sample from a statistical perspective.  ChemoSpec2D takes many of its cues from ChemoSpec
#' and tries to create consistent graphical output and to be very user friendly.  Tools to
#' manipulate and plot 2D spectra and carry out PARAFAC are the main features.
